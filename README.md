## Knights and Warlocks

This repository is for the first game I created using C#. 

It began when I was learning how to instantiate and make 
two objects interact/affect each others properties, 
however everytime I learnt something new I tried to apply 
it into this game; mostly with the intent of learning.

Now I have decided to make it open-source so that I can 
document changes and see what other ideas/implementations 
other people may contribute so that I can continue learning!
